## Current Status
The application is in a functional educational state. It demonstrates the core concepts of full-stack web development with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and EJS. Students can run the application, explore the code, and understand how the different components work together. The new landing page provides a more visually appealing entry point to the application with interactive motorcycle cards.

## Known Issues
1. **Database Reset**: The database is reset on each application restart due to `sequelize.sync({ force: true })`
2. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling in routes
3. **UI**: Basic styling with room for improvement
4. **Security**: No authentication or authorization mechanisms
5. **Testing**: No automated tests
6. **Images**: No proper image upload functionality, using placeholders or predefined images

## Next Development Priorities
1. Improve error handling in routes
2. Enhance UI with additional CSS styling
3. Add form validation for data input
4. Implement pagination for listing pages
5. Add more robust search and filtering functionality
