# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in a functional state with basic CRUD operations for both Motorcycles and Categories. The focus is on educational use, demonstrating full-stack web development concepts to first-year DAM students. A new landing page with interactive motorcycle cards has been added to provide a more engaging user experience.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented both JSON API and EJS web interfaces
- Set up relationships between Categories and Motorcycles
- Added Docker containerization
- Configured development environment with nodemon
- Added a visually appealing landing page with motorcycle cards
- Added JavaScript interactivity for filtering and searching motorcycles
- Integrated country flags and placeholder images for motorcycles

## Active Decisions
1. **Educational Focus**: Code is structured for clarity and learning rather than production optimization
2. **Dual Interface**: Maintaining both API endpoints and web views to demonstrate different approaches
3. **Database Seeding**: Including sample data creation in app.js for immediate usability
4. **Environment Configuration**: Using .env for flexible configuration across environments
5. **Enhanced UI**: Added a card-based landing page with simple JavaScript interactivity

## Current Status
The application is functional with:
- Complete data models
- Working API endpoints
- Basic EJS templates
- Database relationships
- Development environment setup
- Interactive landing page with motorcycle cards
- Simple filtering and search functionality

## Known Issues
- Database is reset on each application restart (`sequelize.sync({ force: true })`)
- Limited error handling in some routes
- Basic UI with minimal styling
- No authentication or authorization
- No unit or integration tests
- Cards use placeholder images when no images are available

## Next Steps
Potential improvements for the project:

### Short-term
1. Add more comprehensive error handling
2. Improve UI with additional CSS styling
3. Add form validation
4. Add pagination for listing pages
5. Enhance search functionality with more options

### Medium-term
1. Add user authentication
2. Create proper database migrations rather than force sync
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Implement image upload for motorcycles
5. Add filtering and sorting options

### Long-term
1. Build a more sophisticated frontend (possibly with React/Vue)
2. Implement user roles and permissions
3. Add more complex relationships between models
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Create comprehensive documentation
