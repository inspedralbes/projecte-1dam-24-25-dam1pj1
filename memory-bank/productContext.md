# Product Context

## Purpose
This tutorial project exists to teach first-year DAM (Development of Multiplatform Applications) students the fundamentals of full-stack web development. It provides a practical, hands-on approach to learning modern web development concepts.

## Problems Solved
1. **Learning Gap**: Bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation of web applications
2. **Technology Integration**: Demonstrates how to integrate multiple technologies (Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, EJS)
3. **Full-Stack Experience**: Provides exposure to both frontend and backend development
4. **Database Relationships**: Shows how to model and implement data relationships
5. **API Development**: Teaches RESTful API design and implementation

## User Experience Goals
1. **Educational Value**: Clear code structure that's easy to understand and learn from
2. **Practical Application**: Functional application that demonstrates real-world web development practices
3. **Dual Interface**: Shows both API and web interface approaches to the same data
4. **Progressive Learning**: Structured to allow students to build upon concepts incrementally
5. **Developer Experience**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns

## Target Audience
- First-year DAM students
- Beginning web developers
- Educators teaching web application development
- Anyone interested in learning Node.js/Express development

## Key Use Cases
1. Students follow along to build a motorcycle catalog application
2. Educators use the project to demonstrate web development concepts
3. Learners experiment with the code to understand different aspects of web development
4. Reference for implementing similar patterns in other projects

## Success Metrics
1. Student comprehension of web development concepts
2. Ability to extend the application with new features
3. Transfer of skills to other projects
4. Confidence in working with Node.js ecosystem
